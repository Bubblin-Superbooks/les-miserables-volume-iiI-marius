<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Samson and the Abbé Montès are the truly popular names. They hoot at the victim in order to encourage him. They sometimes admire him. Lacenaire, when a gamin, on seeing the hideous Dautin die bravely, uttered these words which contain a future: &ldquo;I was jealous of him.&rdquo; In the brotherhood of gamins Voltaire is not known, but Papavoine is. &ldquo;Politicians&rdquo; are confused with assassins in the same legend. They have a tradition as to everybody&rsquo;s last garment. It is known that Tolleron had a fireman&rsquo;s cap, Avril an otter cap, Losvel a round hat, that old Delaporte was bald and bareheaded, that Castaing was all ruddy and very handsome, that Bories had a romantic small beard, that Jean Martin kept on his suspenders, that Lecouffé and his mother quarrelled. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t reproach each other for your basket,&rdquo; shouted a gamin to them.</p></div> </div>
