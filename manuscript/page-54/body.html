<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> If Jehovah himself were present, he would go hopping up the steps of paradise on one foot. He is strong on boxing. All beliefs are possible to him. He plays in the gutter, and straightens himself up with a revolt; his effrontery persists even in the presence of grape-shot; he was a scapegrace, he is a hero; like the little Theban, he shakes the skin from the lion; Barra the drummer-boy was a gamin of Paris; he Shouts: &ldquo;Forward!&rdquo; as the horse of Scripture says &ldquo;Vah!&rdquo; and in a moment he has passed from the small brat to the giant.</p><p>This child of the puddle is also the child of the ideal. Measure that spread of wings which reaches from Moli√®re to Barra.</p></div> </div>
