<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A man condemned to death is listening to his confessor in the tumbrel. The child of Paris exclaims: &ldquo;He is talking to his black cap! Oh, the sneak!&rdquo;</p><p>A certain audacity on matters of religion sets off the gamin. To be strong-minded is an important item.</p><p>To be present at executions constitutes a duty. He shows himself at the guillotine, and he laughs. He calls it by all sorts of pet names: The End of the Soup, The Growler, The Mother in the Blue (the sky), The Last Mouthful, etc., etc. In order not to lose anything of the affair, he scales the walls, he hoists himself to balconies, he ascends trees, he suspends himself to gratings, he clings fast to chimneys. The gamin is born a tiler as he is born a mariner. A roof inspires him with no more fear than a mast. There is no festival which comes up to an execution on the Place de Gr√®ve.</p></div> </div>
