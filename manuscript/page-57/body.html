By light.</p><p>Light renders healthy.</p><p>Light kindles.</p><p>All generous social irradiations spring from science, letters, arts, education. Make men, make men. Give them light that they may warm you. Sooner or later the splendid question of universal education will present itself with the irresistible authority of the absolute truth; and then, those who govern under the superintendence of the French idea will have to make this choice; the children of France or the gamins of Paris; flames in the light or will-o&rsquo;-the-wisps in the gloom.</p></div> </div>
