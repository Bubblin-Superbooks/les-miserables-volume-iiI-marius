<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A funeral passes by. Among those who accompany the dead there is a doctor. &ldquo;Hey there!&rdquo; shouts some street Arab, &ldquo;how long has it been customary for doctors to carry home their own work?&rdquo;</p><p>Another is in a crowd. A grave man, adorned with spectacles and trinkets, turns round indignantly: &ldquo;You good-for-nothing, you have seized my wife&rsquo;s waist!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I, sir? Search me!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
