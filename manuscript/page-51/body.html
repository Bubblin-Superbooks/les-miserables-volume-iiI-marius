<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The gamin in his perfect state possesses all the policemen of Paris, and can always put the name to the face of any one which he chances to meet. He can tell them off on the tips of his fingers. He studies their habits, and he has special notes on each one of them. He reads the souls of the police like an open book. He will tell you fluently and without flinching: &ldquo;Such an one is a traitor; such another is very malicious; such another is great; such another is ridiculous.&rdquo; (All these words: traitor, malicious, great, ridiculous, have a particular meaning in his mouth.) That one imagines that he owns the Pont-Neuf, and he prevents people from walking on the cornice outside the parapet; that other has a mania for pulling person&rsquo;s ears; etc., etc.</p></div> </div>
