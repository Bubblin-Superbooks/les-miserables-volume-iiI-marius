Nevertheless the police keep an eye on him, and the result is a highly dramatic situation which once gave rise to a fraternal and memorable cry; that cry which was celebrated about 1830, is a strategic warning from gamin to gamin; it scans like a verse from Homer, with a notation as inexpressible as the eleusiac chant of the Panathenæa, and in it one encounters again the ancient Evohe. Here it is: &ldquo;Ohé, Titi, ohééé! Here comes the bobby, here comes the p&rsquo;lice, pick up your duds and be off, through the sewer with you!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
