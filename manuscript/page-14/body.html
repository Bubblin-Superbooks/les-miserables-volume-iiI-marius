<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Paris has a child, and the forest has a bird; the bird is called the sparrow; the child is called the gamin.</p><p>Couple these two ideas which contain, the one all the furnace, the other all the dawn; strike these two sparks together, Paris, childhood; there leaps out from them a little being. Homuncio, Plautus would say.</p><p>This little being is joyous. He has not food every day, and he goes to the play every evening, if he sees good. He has no shirt on his body, no shoes on his feet, no roof over his head; he is like the flies of heaven, who have none of these things. He is from seven to thirteen years of age, he lives in bands, roams the streets, lodges in the open air, wears an old pair of trousers of his father&rsquo;s, which descend below his heels, an old hat of some other father, which descends below his ears, a single suspender of yellow listing;</p></div> </div>
